## General Information

The purpose of this project was to test our knowledge based on skills learned to this point:

-JavaScript
-API's

## Technologies Used

- Git Hub
- VS Code - version 1.59.0
- Javascript

## Setup

-This is based off of our 1st Group Project
-ReadMe Instructions located on Git Lab Repo
-New Git Hub Repo
-Read Me file
-script.js
-Git Clone, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push

Once everything was setup, worked in VS Code to create, adjust, a weather dashboard.
-Struggled to get multiple cities to show
-Tried to incorporate Materialize as new technology
-Decided to keep the overall feel simple

## Project Status

Project is: _Continually being updated_. As i learn more JS, react, node etc, i will update this Dashboard in an attempt to make as dynamic as possible.

## Room for Improvement

I think we can further improve this by creating/using local storage. Our group project used the idea of "chips" which I was a big fan of. Could also incorporate a usable map, however for basic understanding this is good enough.

Room for improvement:
-I need more practice with all things JS, however it hasnt been as difficult as I initially thougt. Feels like a distant cousin to VBA.
